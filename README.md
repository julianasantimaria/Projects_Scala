## Overview

Scala is a modern, high-level programming language designed to combine functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is interoperable with Java, making it a popular choice for developers who want to leverage the vast ecosystem of Java libraries while writing concise and expressive code.

Scala's design allows to write concise, expressive, and scalable code, making it an excellent choice for modern, large-scale software development.
